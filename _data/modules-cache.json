botpress-dialog\n\nOfficial Dialog module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress). Uses [dialog-node](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/dialog-node) behind the scenes.\n\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog)\n[![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/botpress-dialog)\n\n## Examples\n\n- [Botpress application with Messenger and Dialog modules](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-example)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ botpress install dialog\n```\n\n## Get Started\n\nConfigure the module with your Dialog API token which is available in your [personal account](http://app.dialoganalytics.com/users/edit), and a bot ID.\n\n<img alt='Configuration' src='/assets/configuration-screenshot.png' width='500px;' />\n\nConfiguration can also be done programmatically by providing the settings in the file `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-dialog.json`.\n\n**Note:** Please note this currently only works with [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the module is installed and configured, every incoming and outgoing messages will be tracked by Dialog.\n\n### Advanced\n\nAdvanced instrumentation is exposed via the `bp.dialog` object. The following methods are available:\n\n#### Events\n\nSend events to Dialog to keep track of your custom logic. Optionally pass an Interlocutor's distinct id to tie the event to one of your bot's interlocutors. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.event('subscribed', 'interlocutorDistinctId', { custom: 'value' })\n```\n\n#### Clicks\n\nRecord clicks by interlocutors inside a conversation using a trackable link. For every links that needs to be tracked, generate a trackable URL by passing the interlocutor's distinct Id (provided by the platform or provider) and the `url` to the `link` method. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking/)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.link('http://example.com', interlocutorDistinctId)\n// https://api.dialoganalytics.com/v1/b/7928374/clicks/?id=123456&url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com\n```\n\n#### Attach\n\nModify the current `track` payload about to be sent to Dialog's API with this helper

botpress-slack\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/botpress/botpress/7e007114/assets/supports_UMM.png\" height=\"60px\" />\n\nOfficial Slack connector module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress).\n\nThis module has been built to accelerate and facilitate development of Slack bots.\n\n## Usage with UMM\n\nThere's 3 supported UMM messages: text, attachments and reactions. For doing anything else, please use code (see the other methods supported in `bp.slack` below).\n\n> **Note on Slack UMM**\n> \n> All of the Slack messages below support an optional **`option`** field which accepts any extra arguments as per the ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)) about **chat.postMessage**.\n\n#### Sending Text\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - Hello, world!\n  - This is a message on Slack!\n  - text: this works too!\n  - |\n    This is a multi-line\n    message :).\n```\n\n#### Sending a single [Attachment](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: slack\n    attachment:\n      title: The Further Adventures of Slackbot\n      fields:\n        - title: Volume\n          value: 1\n          short: true\n        - title: Issue\n          value: 3\n          short: true\n      author_name: Stanford S. Strickland\n      author_icon: https://a.slack-edge.com/bfaba/img/api/homepage_custom_integrations-2x.png\n      image_url: http://i.imgur.com/OJkaVOI.jpg?1\n```\n\n#### Sending a multiple [Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - on: slack\n    attachments:\n\n      - title: The Further Adventures of Slackbot\n        fields:\n          - title: Volume\n            value: 1\n            short: true\n          - title: Issue\n            value: 3\n            short: true\n        author_name: Stanford S. Strickland\n        author_icon: https://a.slack-edge.com/bfaba/img/api/homepage_custom_integrations-2x.png\n        image_url: http://i.imgur.com/OJkaVOI.jpg?1\n\n      - title: Second Attachment\n        fields: [{ title: Price, value: 265$ }]\n```\n\n#### Sending Reaction\n##### `content.yml`\n\n```yaml\nwelcome:\n  - text: Hello, world!\n  - on: slack\n    reaction: smile\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add slack module to their bot.\n\n```js\nbotpress install slack\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo setup connexion of your chatbot to Slack, you need to fill the connexion settings directly in the module interface. In fact, you only need to follow these steps and your bot will be ready to use.\n\nSettings can also be set programmatically by providing the settings in the `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-slack.json`\n\n<img alt='Connexion settings' src='assets/connexion-settings.png' width='700px'/>\n\n#### 1. Setup Hostname\n\nYou need to manually enter your hostname. If you are developping locally, we suggest using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to deploy your chatbot ([learn more about ngrok](https://ngrok.com)\n\n#### 2. Create a [**Slack app**](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)\n  \n<img alt='Create app' src='/assets/create-app-slack.png' width='450px' />\n\n#### 3. Get Client ID and Client Secret\n\nThese information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='Client id and client secret' src='/assets/client-id-client-secret.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 4. Setup OAuth & Permissions\n\nOn the **OAuth & Permissions** page of your slack app, you need to enter your redirect url for the authentification. The redirect url need to be `${hostname}/modules/botpress-slack` as you can see in the example screenshot below.\n\n<img alt='OAuth settings' src='/assets/oauth.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 5. Create a Bot User\n\nOn the **Bot Users** page of your slack app, you need to add a Bot User by clicking on **Add a Bot User**. We suggest you to turn on **Always Show My Bot as Online** for be able to use RTM API correctly.\n\n<img alt='Bot users' src='/assets/bot-user.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 6. Setup Interactive Messages\n\nOn the **Interactive messages** page of your slack app, you need to **Enable Interactive Messages** and add a **Request URL**. The URL entered needs to be format as `${hostname}/api/botpress-slack/action-endpoint`.\n\n<img alt='Interactive messages' src='/assets/interactive-messages.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 7. Get Verification Token\n\nThe verification token should appear below App Id and App  information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='App id and app secret' src='/assets/verification-token.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 8. Set scope\n\nOn your configuration page of your module, you need to set scope of your bot. We suggest you to keep the default configuration (**admin,bot,chat:write:bot,commands,identify,incoming-webhook**), but if you want to want to modify it, we suggest you to look to the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes).\n\n#### 9. Authenticate & Connect\n\nNext step is to authenticate and connect your bot. To do it, you only need to click on **Authenticate & Connect** on your module and follow the steps. Once it will be done, you should received an **API Token** and a **Bot Token**. They will appear on your settings page of your module.\n\n<img alt='Connexion completed' src='/assets/completed.png' width='500px;' />\n\nIf you want to have more information about documentation, options and API, we suggest you to look at the [official slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/).\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Typing](#typing)\n* [File](#file)\n* [User mention](#user-mention)\n* [Bot mention](#bot-mention)\n* [Others](#others)\n* [Direct message](#direct-message)\n* [Validation](#validation)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Update text](#update-text)\n* [Update attachments](#update-attachments)\n* [Delete text or attachments](#delete-text-or-attachments)\n* [Remove reaction](#remove-reaction)\n\n### API\n\n* Status\n* User\n* Users\n* Channels\n* Team\n* Data\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Slack event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', type: 'message', text: 'Hello' }, (event, next) => {\n\tbp.slack.sendText(event.channel.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, reaction, attachments, file, typing...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n\tplatform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)'\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information (`event.user`) by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"id\": \"U023BECGF\",\n  \"team_id\": \"T021F9ZE2\",\n  \"name\": \"bobby\",\n  \"deleted\": false,\n  \"status\": null,\n  \"color\": \"9f69e7\",\n  \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n  \"tz\": \"America\\/Los_Angeles\",\n  \"tz_label\": \"Pacific Daylight Time\",\n  \"tz_offset\": -25200,\n  \"profile\": {\n      \"avatar_hash\": \"ge3b51ca72de\",\n      \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\n      \"last_name\": \"Tables\",\n      \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n      \"email\": \"bobby@slack.com\",\n      \"skype\": \"my-skype-name\",\n      \"phone\": \"+1 (123) 456 7890\",\n      \"image_24\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_32\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_48\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_72\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_192\": \"https:\\/\\/...\"\n  },\n  \"is_admin\": true,\n  \"is_owner\": true,\n  \"has_2fa\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).\n\n#### Text\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Slack platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Reaction\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'reaction',\n\ttext: 'Dany Fortin-Simard reacted using wink',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\treaction: 'wink',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Typing\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'typing',\n\ttext: 'Sylvain Perron is typing',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### File\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'file',\n\ttext: 'Justin Watson shared a file',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tfile: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### User mentioned\n\nUser mentioned is sent each time a user mentions another user in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'user_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'User has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Bot mentioned\n\nBot mentioned is sent to incoming middlewares when your bot is mentioned in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'bot_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'Bot has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Other\n\nSlack connector also receives all other events that come from Real Time Messaging API. You can look at the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/rtm) to have more information about some specific event. \n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'other_types',\n\ttext: 'An another type of event occured',\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Direct message\n\nAs you can see in all incoming events, we added a particular field `direct` to differentiate message that comes from channel or direct.\n\n```\n{\n\tdirect: false\n}\n```\n\n#### Validation\n\nThis module also comes with some validation to be certain that events are coming from Slack API. For that, each incoming event are validated using your verification token.\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Slack. In fact, this module support most important types of messenge that are available on Slack (text, attachments, button, reaction).\n\n#### Creating actions without sending them\n\nNote that all the below actions are available under two format: `send___` and `create____`, the latter effectively only creating the middleware Event without piping (sending) it to the outgoing middleware. This is useful when combining libraries together (for example Botkit):\n\n```js\n  // This message won't be sent\n  const message = bp.slack.createText(event.channel.id, 'What is your name?')\n  // But `message` is a fully formed middleware event object, ready to be sent\n  // example using the botpress-botkit module\n  convo.ask(message, function(response, convo) { /* ... */ })\n```\n\n### Text\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific channel ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)).\n\n#### `sendText(channel, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` channelId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Channel's recipient identifier. Usually, this `channelId` is available from input message.\n\n2. ` text ` (_String_): Text message that will be send to channel.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain possible options for normal `chat.postMessage` (see [documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) for more details)\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the text message that needs to be sent to Slack platform. The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to slack.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', text: 'Hello'}, event => {\n\tconst channelId = event.channel.id\n\tconst text = 'Hello human!'\n\n\tbp.slack.sendText(channelId, text)\n\t.then(() => {\n\t\t//Do something else\n\t})\n})\n\n```\n\n### [Attachments](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments)\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting). Also, you should look to the [message builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) to have a better idea of all possible attachments you can send.\n\n#### `sendAttachments(channelId, attachments, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` channelId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Channel's recipient identifier.
